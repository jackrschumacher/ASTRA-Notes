# Meeting 1/7/26

## Embedded progress
- Have taken a look at the old code and have started to modify it for this year
  - Removed stepper motor library
  - Removed math library - will see if we need to readd this for calculating the amount to be put into each tube

## My Questions

- What type of ESP32 are we using

  - ESP32-S3?
  - Or are we just using the ESP32 devkit

    - **We are planning on using the ESP32 DevKit V1**
      - [It is probably this one](https://www.amazon.com/ESP-WROOM-32-Development-Microcontroller-Integrated-Compatible/dp/B0CR5Y2JVD/ref=pd_lpo_d_sccl_1/144-1649755-4875425?pd_rd_w=ZzRhb&content-id=amzn1.sym.4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&pf_rd_p=4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&pf_rd_r=6JMYSDGY8VGG96XDRHF9&pd_rd_wg=N244w&pd_rd_r=0d969748-0578-4d63-a1eb-68ea210e4dcf&pd_rd_i=B08D5ZD528&th=1)
